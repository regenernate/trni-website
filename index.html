        <p>Listen! We kinda do a little bit of everything. Our scthick is to be educators first, and masons, carpenters, homestead designers, permaculturalists, parents, and all those other things second ... and third ...</p>
        <p><strong>What does that mean for you?</strong></p>
        <p>It's good news!</p>
        <p>It means we can help you get most anything done related to farmstead land and infrastructure including assessment, planning, design, implementation and even site maintenance.</p>
        <p>Together we'll work out a project covering all phases of construction, landscaping and homestead operations. It'll be fun!</p>
