        <p>It's good news!</p>
        <p>It means we can help you get most anything done related to farmstead land and infrastructure <em>including assessment, planning, design, implementation and even site maintenance</em>.</p>
        <img src='/the_offerings.jpg' class='narrow-image h-centered' alt='This is a pencil drawing of a homestead on a steep cliff overlooking the ocean.' />
        <p>Together we'll work out a project plan covering all phases of construction, landscaping and/or homestead operations under improvement.</p><p>We promise, it'll be fun!</p>
