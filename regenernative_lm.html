      <h1>RegenerNative Land Management in Practice</h1>
      <p>This website is intended to provide the tools and techniques ( the principles and practices ), that make it possible to manage land towards regenerative endpoints.</p>
      <p>This is the work of generations. Hard and rewarding work. We appreciate your attention to it.</p>

      <h2>What is RegenerNative?</h2>
      <p>It's a combination of the concepts of Regenerative and Native-first Land Management.</p>
      <p>It can be summarized as utilizing what is available in a given space to set that space up for long term success. Impacting as little as practically possible to make the next change necessary, and the next, until the entire growing system, the entire living system, comes to life as a cohesive whole.</p>
      <p>That's when the fun begins. When we get to sit back and watch the show as insects, birds, reptiles, amphibians, pets, wild animals, people, and everything else all intermingle happily.</p>

      <h3>That's swell, but practically ... ?</h3>
      <p>It means we can manage land to meet our own needs without sacrificing the needs of any other living things.</p>
      <p>This is something humanity seems to have forgotten.</p>
      <p>This practice is designed to help us remember.</p>
