          <h3>The Principles of RegenerNative Agriculture</h3>
          <p>To grow following RegenerNative Practices means:
            <ul>
              <li>Keep soil covered by leaving crop residue and applying organic mulches.</li>
              <li>Seed diversely wherever possible, both above and below the ground.</li>
              <li>Strive to keep a living root in the ground all year ‘round.</li>
              <li>No tillage after establishment, no pesticides or herbicides.</li>
              <li>Manage grazing intensity to minimize soil disturbance.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>The aim of regenerative livestock management is to handle animals in such a way that the land on which they are managed continually becomes healthier.
            <div class='center-quote'>In regenernative terms, healthier means <strong>more diverse</strong>, <strong>more vigorous</strong> and <strong>more resilient</strong></div></p>
          <p>The animals being grazed remain healthy even as we reduce external inputs over time such as dewormers, antibiotics, and manufactured feed supplements.</p>
          <p>Temporary electric polywire and portable solar fence energizers allow regenernative graziers to put fencing pretty much anywhere, which makes it possible to provide the right menu to the right species at the right time.</p>

          <h3>Continually Adapting</h3>
          <p>Just as nature does, regenernative land managers must be constantly adapting to conditions on the ground. The flexibility required allows us to manage based on conditions are at the moment of animal impact, even when things don’t go to plan.</p>

          <h3>The Principles of RegenerNative Grazing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Manage multiple species of animals separately and together, as needed.</li>
              <li>Utilize animal impact through adaptive paddock rotations.</li>
              <li>Seed and graze diverse pastures and forests.</li>
              <li>Avoid managing more animals than the available land can sustain.</li>
              <li>Ensure that animals culled for food are processed humanely.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

        <section>
          <p>When combined together, RegenerNative Land and Animal Management provide a very effective set of tools for managing land towards human production needs without sacrificing ecosystem health. Of course there is a lot more to it than just following a set of principles.</p>
          <p>There is timing, and the sourcing of animals and organic materials. There are coyotes and skunks who eat chickens and baby goats. There are hailstorms and mineral deficient field mice who ravage hemp plants. Don’t forget all the native plants to learn, and the insect poo to identify. There's welding and fencing and hay bailers to repair in the field.</p>
          <p>That's why RegenerNative Land Management is <a href='/the_practice'>a daily practice</a>.</p>
