        <h1>The Point(s) of RegenerNative Land Management</h1>
        <p>Utilizing the strengths of a flexible assessment, planning and design strategy, we can create natural systems that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Improve living conditions for all things found within the system under management, or sum.</li>
          <li>Depend upon real-world validated observations to deepen our understanding of the sum.</li>
          <li>Define and balance key contextual variables before and while building any regenerative system ( light, gravity, water, etc. ).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The practice of RegenerNative Land Management</h2>
        <p>The daily practice of RegenerNative Land Management is one of engagement. You gotta get into the shit of it. Literal, figurative ... whatever.</p>
        <p>In the guts of it is where we find the good. We can see, feel and even communicate with the living web of life that is our natural heritage on this planet.</p>
        <p>You may be moving electric fencing. Unloading hay bales. Shoveling out stalls. Or you may be riding your horse, working your dog, or digging in your garden.</p>
        <p>Whatever that practice is for you ... that's the point of RegenerNative Land Management. To get back to the land by practicing being on the land. :_!</p>
