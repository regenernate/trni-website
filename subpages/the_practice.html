      <h1>How do we RegenerNate land?</h1>
      <p>RegenerNative refers to growing systems which utilize and enhance the evolved ability of plants and animals, in relationship with microbiology, to cycle nutrients within healthy ecosystems.</p>
      <img class='medium-image' src='/nsl_1prepped.jpg' />
      <p>In practice, we want to disturb the soil <em>( and the system )</em> as little as possible. Above you can see our initial estabishment of these on-contour grow beds.</p>
      <img class='medium-image' src='/nsl_2hayed.jpg' />
      <p>It's also best pratice to cover all bare soil as soon as practically possible. This both reduces the compaction potential for your soil and provides food for your soil life to begin digesting.</p>

      <p>Well timed seeding under or atop a good mulch layer almost always leads to a successful cover crop establishment. This is step one in kickstarting your soil's biological machinery.</p>

        <h3>The Nitty Gritty of RegenerNative Land Management</h3>
        <p>Ultimately RegenerNative Managers know we have to learn how to ask the land what it needs, and then we have to learn how to look and listen.</p>
        <p>If you do this faithfully for long enough, youâ€™ll begin to see and hear the answers.</p>
        <p>This is a daily practice of managing to principles. Learn <a href='/the_principles'>those principles here</a>.
