      <h1>The whole is meant to be simple and instructive.</h1>
      <p>Initially, this is a fixed list of terms, but eventually we'd love to have others weigh in on their 50 words ( or less ).</p>
      <p>So:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Return to the terms list ( using the menu items above ).</li>
          <li>Click on the term you like to start with.</li>
          <li>Read the definition and other information.</li>
          <li>Click on the next term of interest ( there are several choices of related terms to pick from ).</li>
        </ol>
      <p>That's it. The list reorganizes itself based on the relationships between terms, depending on which term you start with. Return to the main list at any point and start again with a different term.</p>
      <p><em>Please provide feedback on definitions, missing terms, or terms you don't think belong in this list of 50.</em></p>
      <p>And enjoy! We hope you leave with a better understanding of regenerative land management.</p>
