        <p>There's about a 16 out of 24 chance ... <em>what's that, 2 out of 3,</em> ... that somebody's working here at the Regenernative Hub.</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out - regenernate @ gmail . com. Otherwise, read on ...</p>

        <h2>What is the Regenernation?</h2>
        <p>The regenernation is an intentional return to a true state of appreciation for our natural heritage. The commons. That which is ours to nurture and soothe us.</p>
        <p>It begins with the literal ground you walk on. Your path to and from work, maybe. The trail out your back door that leads to the woods?</p>
        <p><em>In the end it is simple</em>. The regenernation is my home. It's our home. It's the United States, the world ... you know ... planet Earth.</p>

        <h3>Still kinda abstract ... what IS it?</h3>
        <p>Well, its a combination of several for-profit businesses with a not-for-profit, all focused on strengthening local food security through <strong>education and installation</strong> of RegenerNative habitats.</p>

        <h3>Ok, so who, or what is Regenernate?</h3>
        <p>Interesting question. We are still trying to figure that out ourselves.</p>
        <p>Although <em>regenernate</em> started out as a clever email address for an individual, it quickly became
        representative of something a bit more grand.</p>
        <img class='fullwidth-image' id="picofnate" alt="In this picture, Nathan, the original regenernator, is knee deep in the poo pile." name="picofnate" src="/heres_nathan.jpg" />
        <label for="picofnate">Here you can see Nathan, the original regenernator, knee deep in horse crap ( as per usual ).</label>
        <p>As for the something grander, here is what we now believe to be true at Regenernate:</p>
        <section class='h-centered bordered-section'>
          <ul class='undecorated-list'>
            <li style="padding-right:5rem;">Humans have a far greater capacity for sensing, understanding, and engaging with the living world around us than we let ourselves believe.</li>
            <li style="padding-left:2rem;padding-right:3rem;">Humans are capable of constantly doing better in all aspects of relationship with the living world, be it with other humans, with animals, with forests or even individual trees.</li>
            <li style="padding-left:4rem;padding-right:1rem;">Humans can change. We can change in ways that are meaningful. In ways that persist. Ways that continually make the Earth a better place for all living things that call her home.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Our role as people Here</h4>
          <p>We believe that we all have a role to play in making the world a better place. But beliefs donâ€™t build bridges. <em>The proof will be in the pudding</em>.</p>
          <p>In our case, that pudding will be a delicious, diverse and resilient collage of landscapes and ecosystems, all healthier, more vibrant and more abundant as a result of the management activities we have undertaken upon them.</p>
          <h5>How do we Make It?</h5>
          <p>The RegenerNation, built by Regenernators is a practice of integrating landscapes with the living things that dwell upon them.</p>
          <p>This includes encouraging the conditions for a comfortable re-integration of people into their proper place on the land they inhabit.</p>
          <p>With a touch of patience, a lot of hard work, and the constant grounding to be found in daily work for this living world we call home, this work can be done.</p>
          <p><strong>This is the work of the Regenernation.</strong></p>
