      <h1>What the heck is RegenerNative design?</h1>

      <img src='/regenernated_elephant.jpg' class='medium-image' />

      <p>In short, it's using the shit around you to create self-regenerating growing systems.</p>

      <h2>Think about Regenerative plus Native ... you know ... of here ...</h2>

      <p>Yep, it's really that simple. Turns out the things we actually need will grow happily in the places we put them, if we put them in places they will happily grow. It's one of those crazy natural cycles and let me tell you, it works.</p>
      <p>Sure you can use vermicompost. Sure you can do microscopy. Yes you can mow and till if that's your thing. You don't need to, but you can.</p>
      <p>Thats the RegenerNative difference - designs can adjust to the preferences of the people living with them.</p>
