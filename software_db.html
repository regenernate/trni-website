        <h1>What kind of software do you build?</h1>
        <p>Here recently we've built several custom node servers for web hosting. Prior to that we've built everything from manufacturing software for a small family farm to translational layers for big data systems.</p>
        <p>And way back 20 years ago now, we made molecule drawing, equation displaying, adaptive homework systems for high school and university students.</p>
        <p>We've been around the software block which makes life a lot easier for you.

        <h2>What makes you different</h2>
        <p>Our continually adaptive process is a big piece of what makes us different. We try to be constantly iterating on the idea of the solution we are trying to build.</p>
        <p>We also are focused on clear and accurate communication with our customers.</p>
        <p>Finally, we build solutions in javascript, html and css only. If you need more than that, we'd argue you're trying to do too much with your tech.</p>
