      <h1>Our Educational Offerings</h1>
      <p>The RegenerNative Institute is a for-profit multi-species ( and age ) program run by the same folks who are responsible for this web content.</p>
      <p>It is in-person, outdoors, and sometimes also virtual, indoors. Individual groups can be small or large, depending upon the lesson(s) of the day.</p>
      <img src='/colored_offerings.jpg' class='medium-image' alt="This sketch is a familiar penciled landscape inked over with four primary colors in several shades." />
      <p>Among other things, we color, draw, make music, dance, learn to identify living things, learn to walk quietly in the woods, and practice practical math.</p>
      <h2>Our policies ... on brief(s).</h2>
      <img src='/policies_in_briefs.jpg' class='thenarrowest-image h-centered' alt='This pencil sketch shows the random superhero briefs of policy fame.' />
      <ol>
        <li><p>Our educators and students are expected to behave in a non-denominational manner, and we do not tolerate discrimination for any reason.</p></li>
        <li><p>Otherwise, we look for and encourage safe, sweet, tolerant, helpful and kind actions and words where possible.</p></li>
        <li><p>And we require courteous language, even in midst of disagreement.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <div class='quoted'>
        <p class='smallfont'>Violation of these policies may result in expulsion from the school and its premesis.</p>

      <h2>Now for the Good Stuff</h2>
      <p>If you're at all serious about enrolling someone - yourself, a spouse, one or many children, there is some basic info following, but you should really just set up a virtual consult.</p>
      <p class='quoted'>Its free for thirty minutes and is designed to fast track you to the type of educational offerings you might enjoy most.</p>
      <p>To sign up for an educational consultation, <a href='/schedule_a_consult/educational_consult'>click here now</a>.</p>
      <h3>Costs and class sizes</h3>
      <p>We offer flexible pricing to meet the needs, expectations and capacities of each potential "student/family unit."</p>
      <img src='/sliding_scale.jpg' class='medium-image' alt='This drawing represents the beautiful simplicity of our for-profit, for-people pricing models.' />
      <p>For instance, if one were interested in a specific discipline or skill, we could set up a workshop with a per day rate ( like $20 per hour minimum 5 hours + materials and fuel ).</p>
      <p>Alternatively, if one wanted to enroll a child for a full season of coursework, <em>this could range from $150 to $1800 per month</em>, depending on the number of classes and the resources needed internally to teach skills at an appropriate level.</p>
      <img src='/payment_packages.jpg' class='narrow-image h-centered' alt='This simple document shows several payment options including one-time, weekly or even monthly for a season.' />
      <p class='quoted'>We will have to talk details before we can talk details, if you know what we mean.</p>
      <h3>Availability and Schedule</h3>
      <p>We strive to be available to meet the needs of learners across our community whenever they are ready to engage.</p>
      <p>That said, we are currently gauging interest for a limited number of summer sessions and we're actively taking enrollment for our Fall 2022 homeschool semesters in two groups, ages 3-5 and ages 10-14.</p>
      <img src='/summer_schedule.jpg' class='medium-image' alt='This is a sketch of some possibilities for our 2022 summer educational offerings including soccer camp and nature art school.' />
      <p>Other educational opportunities are available. Please reach out with specific questions or ideas.</p>
