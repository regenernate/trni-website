        <p>Listen! We kinda do a little bit of everything. <i>Our schtick is to be educators first</i>, and masons, carpenters, homestead designers, permaculturalists, parents, and all those other things second ... and third ...</p>
        <p><strong>What does that mean for you?</strong></p>
        <p>It's good news!</p>
        <p>It means we can help you get most anything done related to farmstead land and infrastructure <em>including assessment, planning, design, implementation and even site maintenance</em>.</p>
        <img src='/the_offerings.jpg' class='narrow-image h-centered' alt='This is a pencil drawing of a homestead on a steep cliff overlooking the ocean.' />
        <p>Together we'll work out a project plan covering all phases of construction, landscaping and/or homestead operations under improvement.</p><p>We promise, it'll be fun!</p>
        <p>So is any of that what you were looking for?</p>
